# Close Stale Issues and PRs

Warns and then closes issues that have had no activity for a  specified amount of time.

### Dry Run

To ensure you don't spam your users and close or label incorrect issues this action defaults to running without actually performing any action, we call this a dry run.

To allow the action to actually perform any action set `dry-run` to true.

### Usage

See [action.yml](./action.yml) For comprehensive list of options.

```yaml
name: "Close stale issues"

    steps:
    - uses: DeMoorJasper/stale@v1
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        stale-message: 'Message to comment on stale issues. If none provided, will not mark issues stale'
        dry-run: true
